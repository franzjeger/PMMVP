//! Windows Hello user-presence verification, parented to a real window.
//!
//! This replaces `robius-authentication` on Windows, whose implementation broke
//! Frank's keyboard: it parents the Hello prompt to `GetDesktopWindow()` — a
//! window that cannot legitimately receive focus for it — and then forces focus
//! with a synthesized Alt keypress (`keybd_event(VK_MENU, ...)`, borrowed from
//! Bitwarden). When anything interrupts between the synthetic Alt-down and
//! Alt-up, the key stays logically held: every subsequent keystroke becomes an
//! Alt-chord and the keyboard is unusable until something resets key state —
//! in practice, logging out.
//!
//! The OS way needs no tricks. `IUserConsentVerifierInterop::
//! RequestVerificationForWindowAsync` exists precisely so Win32 apps can parent
//! the prompt to THEIR window; a correctly-parented dialog takes focus by
//! itself. One rule remains ours to keep: never call this from a thread whose
//! message pump must keep running — the caller blocks on the operation, so it
//! must sit on a worker thread while the UI thread stays live.
