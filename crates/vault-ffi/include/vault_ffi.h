/* vault-ffi — C ABI over vault-core for native platform integrations.
 *
 * Hand-maintained to match crates/vault-ffi/src/lib.rs (ABI version 14). All
 * out-buffers are heap-allocated by the library and must be released with
 * vault_ffi_free(ptr, len), which also zeroes them.
 *
 * ABI_VERSION in lib.rs is the authority, and vault_ffi_abi_version() reports
 * it at runtime; clients should refuse to run against a number they were not
 * written for. Tests in lib.rs check that this file names the same version and
 * declares every exported symbol, because "hand-maintained" is otherwise a
 * promise nothing enforces — this comment claimed v2 for a v3 library.
 *
 * Return codes:
 *    0  OK
 *   -1  null argument
 *   -2  invalid UTF-8 in a C string argument
 *   -3  operation failed (unrecognized format / generic)
 *   -4  vault is locked
 *   -5  item not found
 *   -6  a panic was caught at the boundary
 *   -7  decryption failed (wrong key / not a device-unlock vault / tampered)
 *   -8  device key was not 32 bytes
 *   -9  a sync cycle failed; the reason is in the status JSON's lastError

/* ---- Passwords surface (ABI v2) ----------------------------------------
 *
 * Opaque handle to an unlocked vault. Vault open/unlock is done here because
 * Swift can't run Argon2id/XChaCha20; Swift supplies the encrypted file bytes
 * (read from the shared App Group container) and the 32-byte device key (from
 * the shared keychain).
 *
 * OWNERSHIP / THREADING (relaxed in ABI v5): the vault behind a VaultHandle is
 * internally synchronized, so calls on one handle from different threads no
 * longer need external locking — which is what makes it safe to sync on a
 * background thread while the UI reads. vault_ffi_vault_free must still NOT
 * overlap any other call on the same handle, and must be called exactly once.
 *
 * Note that from v5 a handle's CONTENTS can change underneath you: a sync
 * merges a peer's items into the very vault the handle exposes, so a list taken
 * before a sync may be stale afterwards. A read that lands during the merge
 * BLOCKS until it finishes (milliseconds, and no network happens inside that
 * window) — one more reason not to call this from a UI thread.
 *
 * While the handle is open the decrypted vault (passwords included) is resident
 * in memory, so open, fetch the one password you need, and free the handle
 * promptly. */
