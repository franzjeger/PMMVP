//! End-to-end encrypted vault sync, independent of any UI or platform.
//!
//! This was ~670 lines inside the Tauri desktop crate, which meant nothing else
//! could call it — and "nothing else" included the iOS app, for which it is the
//! difference between a real password manager and a viewer you hand-feed a file
//! (see `docs/IOS.md`). Moving it out is what makes a second client possible.
//!
//! The security model is unchanged and worth restating: the remote holds
//! **ciphertext only**. The vault is sealed with Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305
//! before it leaves the machine, so the storage provider is transport and never
//! trust. Nothing in this crate can decrypt anything.
//!
//! ## What is abstracted, and why
//!
//! Three traits, each standing where a platform difference actually is:
//!
//! * [`RemoteStore`] — the remote side. [`drive::DriveStore`] is Google Drive's
//!   `appDataFolder`; the fake in this crate's tests is the other implementation,
//!   and it is what finally makes the cycle's decisions testable. That logic
//!   guards against clobbering a peer's changes and had no tests at all while it
//!   lived in the app.
//! * [`LocalVault`] — the local side. The engine never sees a `Vault`; it asks
//!   for "merge these copies and give me the bytes to push". The merge *policy*
//!   is [`merge_remotes`] so every platform applies the same one.
//! * [`SyncObserver`] — progress. The desktop turns these into Tauri events; a
//!   phone would drive an observable property.
//!
//! Authentication is deliberately NOT a trait. Refreshing a token is an HTTP
//! POST and lives in [`oauth`]; obtaining one the first time is a loopback
//! listener on desktop and `ASWebAuthenticationSession` on iOS, with nothing
//! useful in common, so each caller runs its own and hands over the result.
//!
//! ## The engine's invariants
//!
//! Carried over verbatim from the desktop implementation, which had been through
//! adversarial review; the tests here are the first mechanical check of them:
//!
//! * one cycle at a time, across the background loop and any manual trigger;
//! * upload only when something actually changed — local edits, a merge, or a
//!   bootstrap — so an idle app does not rewrite the remote every 30 seconds;
//! * the remote checksum is recorded **only from our own upload response**,
//!   never from a listing, so a peer's concurrent upload can never be mistaken
//!   for content we already integrated;
//! * a cheap checksum preflight before pushing; if the remote moved under us the
//!   whole cycle re-runs rather than overwriting what we have not merged;
//! * multiple remote files (a create race) are all merged, the oldest kept, the
//!   extras deleted;
//! * a remote written by a NEWER format is refused, never "repaired".
