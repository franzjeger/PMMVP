# One .a per platform in its own directory, picked by the SDK-conditional
# LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS in apps/ios/project.yml. Two are needed because device
# and simulator are different *platforms*, not two architectures of one.
#
# NOT an xcframework, though docs/IOS.md originally asked for one and the first
# cut of this script built one. Xcode resolves a framework dependency when it
# sets the target up — before any pre-build script runs — so an xcframework this
# project builds itself can never exist in time:
#
#   error: There is no XCFramework found at '.../libs/VaultFFI.xcframework'
#   note: Run script build phase 'Build vault-ffi (Rust xcframework)' will be run
#         during every build
#
# Library search paths are resolved at LINK time, after this script has run,
# which is also exactly how apps/macos links the same library. An xcframework is
# the right packaging for a binary shipped to someone else; for a library built
# from source in the same repo it only breaks a clean checkout.
#
# Run from anywhere; the Xcode pre-build phase in apps/ios/project.yml calls it.

# narrow that to, so Xcode links both — an arm64-only lib fails with
# "ignoring file ... found architecture 'arm64', required architecture 'x86_64'"
# followed by every vault_ffi_* symbol undefined. lipo puts both in one archive.
