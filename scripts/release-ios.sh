# One-time setup, both on Frank's Apple account and therefore not scriptable:
#
#   1. An app record at appstoreconnect.apple.com for bundle id
#      no.sybr.vault.ios. Without it the upload is rejected with a message
#      about the bundle id not being found, which reads like a signing problem
#      and is not one.
#
#   2. An App Store Connect API key with the ADMIN role, so this can sign and
#      upload without a password living anywhere. Users and Access ▸ Integrations
#      ▸ App Store Connect API ▸ generate a key, then:
#
#      The role matters and "App Manager" is not enough. App Manager can upload
#      a build but cannot ask Apple for a signing certificate, and the export
#      then fails with "Cloud signing permission error" — which sounds like a
#      network problem and is a permissions one. Admin can do both.
