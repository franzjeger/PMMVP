# Backup and recovery

Arca is zero-knowledge: the master password never leaves your machine and is
never stored. That is the point, and it is also the risk. **Nobody can recover
your vault for you.** This document is the plan for the day something goes
wrong.

## What protects you, and against what

| Failure | What saves you |
| --- | --- |
| Deleted an entry, a bulk merge ate too much, a sync merge went wrong | **Local snapshots** (automatic) |
| Disk died, laptop lost or stolen, macOS reinstall | **Off-device backup** + Google Drive sync |
| Vault file corrupted mid-write | Atomic writes, plus snapshots |
| Forgot the master password | **Nothing.** See "The one unrecoverable case". |

## Local snapshots (automatic)

Before every save, Arca copies the vault as it was *just before* the change.
Retention is tiered: the **last 5 saves**, plus the **newest of each of the last
7 days**. That covers both "undo what I just did" and "something broke a few
days ago and I only noticed now".

Snapshots live next to the vault:

```
~/Library/Application Support/no.sybr.vault/snapshots/     # macOS
%APPDATA%\no.sybr.vault\snapshots\                         # Windows
```

They are byte-for-byte copies of the **encrypted** container. A snapshot is
exactly as safe as the vault itself: same ciphertext, same master password,
nothing in plaintext.

**Restoring:** Settings → *Earlier versions* → *Restore*. Restoring snapshots
the current state first, so a restore is itself undoable. Arca locks afterwards,
because a snapshot may predate a master-password change and must be unlocked
with the password that was in effect when it was written.

> Snapshots are on the same disk as the vault. They do not protect you from
> losing the machine. That is what the off-device backup is for.

## Off-device backup (do this today)

Settings → *Back up the vault* writes a copy of the encrypted vault wherever you
choose. Because it is ciphertext, it is safe on a USB stick, a NAS, or another
computer: without your master password it is noise.

**Restoring from it:** quit Arca, copy the backup over the vault file below,
start Arca, unlock with the master password that backup used.

```
~/Library/Application Support/no.sybr.vault/default.vault  # macOS
%APPDATA%\no.sybr.vault\default.vault                      # Windows
```

Take a fresh backup after any bulk change (a large import, a master-password
change) and otherwise every few months.

## Google Drive sync is redundancy, not backup

Sync keeps devices in step; it is not a time machine. A deletion or a bad merge
propagates to every device within a minute. Sync protects you from a dead disk.
Snapshots protect you from a bad edit. You want both.

## The one unrecoverable case

If you forget the master password, the vault is gone. There is no reset link, no
support override, no back door: the master password is the only thing that
derives the key, and Arca stores nothing that could reconstruct it. This is the
deliberate trade for a vault that nobody else can open.

Mitigate it **before** you need to:

- Store the master password in a password manager you already trust, or write it
  down and keep it somewhere physically safe (a home safe, a sealed envelope).
- Keep an off-device backup so a lost machine is not also a lost vault.
- Export a CSV before a master-password change if you want a readable escape
  hatch. Treat that file as radioactive: it is every password in plaintext.
  Delete it when done.

## Emergency kit (fill in and keep offline)

```
Arca emergency kit
------------------
Vault file:      ~/Library/Application Support/no.sybr.vault/default.vault
Backup copy at:  ____________________________  (USB / NAS / other machine)
Backup taken:    ______________
Master password: stored in ____________________  (NOT written here)
Sync account:    ____________________________
Restore: copy the backup over the vault file above, start Arca, unlock.
```

Print it, fill it in by hand, keep it with your other important papers. Do not
write the master password on it.
