// State for the AutoFill extension: unlock, then either fill the credential the
// OS named or show the ones matching the site.
//
// The extension is a SEPARATE PROCESS from the app, so it cannot borrow the
// app's unlocked session. It opens the vault itself: with the device key from
// the shared keychain when the user has turned quick unlock on — a biometric and
// a symmetric unwrap — and otherwise with the master password, which costs a
// full Argon2id derivation on every single fill. That difference is why
// `vault_ffi_enable_device_unlock` exists.
