// Tests for the Swift↔Rust bridge.
//
// The first Swift tests in this repository, and they exist for one reason above
// the others: `apps/macos/README.md` lists two invariants that are easy to
// break, and says of the second — VaultShared.requiredAbiVersion matching
// ABI_VERSION in the Rust — that *nothing enforces it, because there is no
// Swift test target*. There is now, and it does.
//
// Deliberately narrow. Everything here is either pure Swift logic or a call
// across the C ABI that needs no vault, no keychain and no user: opening a real
// vault needs a file in an App Group container and a biometric prompt, neither
// of which exists on a CI runner. What is left is still worth pinning — it is
// the layer where a silent mismatch fills the wrong bytes into a login form.
