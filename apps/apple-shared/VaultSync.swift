// Swift side of the sync surface (vault-ffi ABI v5, `vault_ffi_sync_*`).
//
// The whole cycle — the Drive REST calls, TLS, token refresh, retry policy —
// runs in Rust. Swift supplies only the two things that have no portable form:
// the interactive sign-in (iOS cannot bind a loopback socket, so it needs
// ASWebAuthenticationSession) and storage (the refresh token goes in the
// keychain, merged vault bytes go in the app group container).
//
// Everything here is `async` and runs on `VaultSession`'s serial queue. Two
// reasons, the same two as the rest of the bridge: a sync cycle blocks on the
// network, and the C ABI forbids overlapping calls on one handle.
