//! Biometric (Touch ID) gate for quick unlock.
//!
//! This is a *presence* gate placed in front of the keychain-backed quick
//! unlock: before the app uses the stored device key to unlock the vault, the
//! device owner must authenticate with Touch ID (falling back to the login
//! password). It does **not** change how the device key is stored.
//!
//! Security note: the device key itself stays protected by the OS keychain
//! (see `vault-store`), not by this prompt. A process running as the same user
//! (threat T9 in `THREAT_MODEL.md`, explicitly out of scope) could still read
//! the keychain entry directly without passing this prompt. OS-enforced
//! biometric gating of the key itself (a `SecAccessControl`-protected keychain
//! item that the OS will not release without Touch ID) is the stronger,
//! Apple-equivalent design and is tracked as a hardening follow-up.
//!
//! The unsafe FFI lives inside `robius-authentication`; this module uses only
//! its safe API, so the crate-wide `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` still holds.
