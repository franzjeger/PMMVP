// Arca — macOS AutoFill Credential Provider (passwords), M2 real vault.
//
// Fills the user's ACTUAL passwords: opens the shared vault via the Rust FFI
// (Touch ID reads the device key from the shared keychain), then returns the
// selected credential. The password is copied straight into ASPasswordCredential
// and never retained. Reading the key is user interaction, so the quick-fill
// (no-UI) entry point defers to the UI entry point where the Touch ID prompt is
// expected.
//
// Every vault call is awaited, never blocking: `VaultSession` does the keychain
// read, the file read and the decrypt on its own queue. The main actor stays
// free to draw while the Touch ID prompt is up — an extension that wedges its
// main thread gets killed rather than merely looking slow.
